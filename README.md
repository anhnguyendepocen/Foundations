# Data Science Foundations
This repository contains a set of jupyter notebooks covering the core concepts of **Statistics** and **Machine Learning**. After going through almost an infinite number of books suggested by colleagues, and multitude of online courses, I decided to go through each chapter of the book titled 'Statistics and Machine Learning in Python' (by Edouard Duchesnay and Tommy LÃ¶fstedt). It is a promising book in teaching the reader all the fundamental concepts necessary to tackle interesting projects in data science and machine learning using python. I have copied a large portion of the codes from this book. I have, however, tweaked the code slightly at certain places and I have tried to implement my own ideas. This structured learning will be of use for me to start working on machine learning problems and to get familiar with the subject specific notations and names of the concepts.

## List of topics:
  1. Introduction to Machine Learning
  2. Python Language
  3. Numpy: arrays and matrices
  4. Pandas: data manipulation
  5. Matplotlib: data visualization
  6. Univariate statistics
  7. Multivariate statistics
  8. Dimension reduction and feature reduction
  9. Clustering
  10. Linear methods for regression
  11. Linear classification
  12. Non linear learning algorithms
  13. Resampling methods
  14. Scikit-learn processing pipelines
  15. Case studies of ML
