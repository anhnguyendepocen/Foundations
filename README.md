# Data_Science_Foundations
After going through almost an infinite number of resources on internet, and all the books suggested by friends and collegues, and multitude of online courses, I have finally decided to go through each chapter of the book titled 'Statistics and Machine Laerning in Python by Edouard Duchesnay, Tommy LÃ¶fstedt' each day, at a rate of one chapter per day, starting tomorrow. It looks promising in teaching the reader all the foundations necessary to tackle big and interesting projects in Data Science. I will blatantly copy the code from this book. I will, however, tweak the code slightly and try to implement my own ideas. There are a few problems at the end of each chapter, to which I will provide solutions in my notebooks. Although, I am already familier with a lots of topics in the book, I think, structured learning will be of immense use for me to start working on machine learning problems. I will perhaps also add bits and pieces conveying the status of each topic according to my own understanding of the field. 

## List of topics:
  1. Introduction to Machine Learning
  2. Python Langauge
  3. Numpy: arrays and matrices
  4. Pandas: data manipulation
  5. Matplotlib: data visualization
  6. Univariate statistics
  7. Multivariate statistics
  8. Dimenstion reduction and feature reduction
  9. Clustering
  10. Linear methods for regression
  11. Linear classification
  12. Non linear learning algorithms
  13. Resampling methods
  14. Scikit-learn processing pipelines
  15. Case studies of ML
