# Data Science Foundations
This repository contains a set of jupyter notebooks covering the core concepts of **Statistics** and **Machine Learning**. I have decided to go through each chapter of the book titled 'Statistics and Machine Learning in Python' (by Edouard Duchesnay and Tommy LÃ¶fstedt). It is a wonderful book in teaching the reader all the fundamental concepts necessary to tackle interesting projects in data science and machine learning using python. 

## List of topics:
  1. Introduction to Machine Learning
  2. Python Language
  3. Numpy: arrays and matrices
  4. Pandas: data manipulation
  5. Matplotlib: data visualization
  6. Univariate statistics
  7. Multivariate statistics
  8. Dimension reduction and feature reduction
  9. Clustering
  10. Linear methods for regression
  11. Linear classification
  12. Non linear learning algorithms
  13. Resampling methods
  14. Scikit-learn processing pipelines
  15. Case studies of ML
